## Tribute64 for Switch Code (Atmega32U4)

This one is a WORK IN PROGRESS sketch + PCB for use with retro-bit's Tribute64, in order to give it
proper right stick functionality, making it compatible with N64 NSO and other games/apps.

The Code itself has proper Button-Debounce, and 3 Modes of input.


## Building Instructions

- Download Arduino IDE, 

- Download the Bounce2 Library inside the Arduino IDE
- Download Arduino Lufa from https://github.com/Palatis/Arduino-Lufa and follow the instructions on it's repository
- Build and Flash for your ATMEGA32U4 Board
- Have Fun
